This repository contains the supporting materials for the manuscript: Jonathan Phillips & B. R. George, Non-Reducibility with Knowledge *wh*: Experimental Investigations

The analysis code (written in R) is in "knowledge_wh_analyses.R". This code reads in the data for the different experiments labeled "know_wh_studyX". Along with the data (in .csv format), the .qsf files with the original stimuli used to conduct the study through Qualtrics and a publication quality graph should be uploaded. 

A pdf of the manuscript and LaTeX code for generating it and will be included eventually.
