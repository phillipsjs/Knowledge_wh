This repository contains the supporting materials for the manuscript: Jonathan Phillips & B. R. George, Knowledge *wh* and False Beliefs: Experimental Investigations

The analysis script (written in R) is titled "knowledge_wh_analyses.R" and reads in the data (in .csv format) for the different experiments labeled "know_wh_studyX". The mansucript, figures, and associated latex code are also available.

A word doc version of of the original stimuli used to conduct the studies will be uploaded soon (along with the .qsf files used by Qualtrics).
